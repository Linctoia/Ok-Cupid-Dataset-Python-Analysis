# Ok-Cupid-Dataset-Python-Analysis
Analysis of Pandas  Dataframes consisting of over 50,000 OKC users
Code was processed using Google Colab, a Google powered Collaborative type of Juptyer notebook. 

Highlights of the work my code goes into:

•	Cleaned data feature by feature, using RegEx to identify and correct messy strings and converting incorrectly entered “Date” data into proper Datetime format

•	Built Data Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib, assessed user trends performing statistical analysis with NumPy. 

•	Found the majority of sample OKC users were ages 20-30, most likely low income-middle class, and avoid drug use.
